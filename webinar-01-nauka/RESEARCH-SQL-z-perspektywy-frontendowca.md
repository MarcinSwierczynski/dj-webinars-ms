```
I'm an frontend engineer experienced in js, react, ts etc.
But I don't have experience in SQL databases and my knowledge in the area is poor. I don't yet know what I don't know.

I'm deeply experienced in frontend programming, I know basics of architecture in general, so you can relate to well known programming topics. But I don't know backend technologies.

I want to go deep into SQL Databases and I want you to prepare a list of topics I should learn. Please group them by level (foundations, advanced, expert). Each topic should be something that people teach on courses or in other materials. The name should be rather succinct, and followed by short, 1-sentence explanation, which outlines WHY the topic is important to learn

---------------------------------------------------------

As for the "Foundations" section, please generate a tutorial that covers these topics (point 1 - 10) in the following way:
- topic name
- syntax examples (if applies). If you think that multiple different examples are important - include them.
- very short text explanation (preferrably 1-sentence)
- if there are any concepts to explain, please provide a bullet point list with a 1-2 sentence explanation.

If possible, try to relate all examples and concepts relate to the same concept. As an example, let's relate to a database from e-commerce domain. All SQL code examples etc. would relate to e-commerce for clarity.

---------------------------------------------------------

ok, now let's walk into "advanced" section, and I want to focus only on one topic: "Complex Joins", as I imagine it could be more difficult than the foundations (or more things to learn).

At this point, I don't know what I don't know about joins. First, outline what are the important things to learn here. Outline, whether it's something more code-related, performance related, is it an abstract concept?

Depending on the type of the topic, please include code, explanation, the context on why is something important. Also, maybe some good or bad practices might be important there? Maybe a diagram would be helpful?

---------------------------------------------------------

when it comes to joins, what are the most commonly used joins? Which are the must-have for me at the beginning of my learning journey?
Please make this answer mostly a bullet-point list with rather little text

---------------------------------------------------------

can you please now provide 3 exercises for me, where you put some SQL code where a small part is blank - and I'm supposed to fill it in? First, display all the exercises (one by one). and all the answers are at the very end. Each answer is followed by some explanation.

---------------------------------------------------------

hm, I think for each exercise you should first include the table(s) schema, so that I know what are the exact tables structures/column names. Please redo with this information.

---------------------------------------------------------

ok, let's go back to all points in "advanced" chapter

You can see my preferred style of learning. Please create a mindmap (mermaid, markdown) of the topics (along with their subtopics and potentially subsubtopics) from all things "advanced". When code is important, provide a keyword or a pattern that best summarizes the topic (so that I can learn it next). If a pattern is important, performance, good practices, etc - please include them.

Each topic should have a very short 1-sentence summary of what the topic is about

---------------------------------------------------------

hmm, please rewrite the mind map and drop these icons (`::icon(fa fa-rocket)`). It'd be better without them.
