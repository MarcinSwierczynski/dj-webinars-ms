I'm an engineer experienced in backend and devops.
But I have no experience in react and my knowledge in the area is poor. I don't yet know what I don't know. But I have to learn it for my upcoming project

I'm very experienced in java, databases, docker, kl8s etc, and architecture in general, so you can relate to these programming topics.

I want to go deep into react and I want you to prepare a list of topics I should learn. Please group them by level (foundations, advanced, expert). Each topic should be something that people teach on courses or in other materials. The name should be rather succinct, and followed by short, 1-sentence explanation, which outlines WHY the topic is important to learn.

Also, be practical in your suggestions. Maybe there are non react-specific topics, which I should also get to know - include them please, outlining why I should

---------------------------------------------------------

let's walk into the foundations and "1. React Component Basics". I want you to specify the concepts a react developer has to be aware of. What are these building blocks?

For each of these building blocks, please provide a rather short example code and explanation which outlines why that building block is important (and what it does)

If two or more building blocks, combined together, form a new thing with some benefits, please include it as well.

---------------------------------------------------------

in the "JSX Transformation" - what do you mean that the "HTML-like syntax compiles to JavaScript function calls" - who exactly does that? Why is that being done? Probably I'm missing some context.

Also, please tell me how many people perform this activity, whether it's a standard, and why.

Make your answer succinct and rather short.

---------------------------------------------------------

please turn the most recent reply above into very succinct bullet points, provide just the key takeaways for me

---------------------------------------------------------

great. Now let's look broadly at "foundations" section from original post/answer. Let's use a common example - let it be an room booking domain/application (like booking.com). Please generate a tutorial with 10+ steps, where each step is a task for me to do, each introduces a concept by incrementing all that has been done in previous steps. I want to learn by coding small steps and progress.

---------------------------------------------------------

I've got questions related to step 1:

what do all these commands do? Please explain step by step. Also, I'm missing experience in using `npm` and node.js. Are the above commands standard commands? What are the top 5 typical operations should I know about npm to be productive?

---------------------------------------------------------

when it comes to all topics included in the "Advanced - Deeper React Patterns and Ecosystem" section - what would be the most important ones from each? I don't know how many "advanced hooks" there are. I don't know whether custom hooks are important or context API etc. But I guess there might be _some_ important things among them. Could you please generate a coding tutorial where we BRIEFLY touch each aspect, so that I get a rough idea what is it about?

So this one should be the overview of what's hidden in all the "advanced" topics. We don't go into nuances - the objective is for me to get a nice overview on why something matters.
